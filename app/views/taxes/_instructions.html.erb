<p>Your task is to create a simple app, which calculates taxes based on income. The taxation is progressive, meaning that the higher the income, the higher the tax.</p>

<p>These are the rules for taxation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>income below 100,000 is taxed by 10%</li>
  <li>income between 100,000 and 150,000 is taxed by 13%</li>
  <li>income above 150,000 is taxed by 17%</li>
</ul>

<p>Some examples:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Income</td>
    <td>Taxes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10,000</td>
    <td>1,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>110,000</td>
    <td>11,300</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>160,000</td>
    <td>18,200</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This is what you should not forget about while working on the task:</p>
<ul>
  <li>correct implementation of tax calculation</li>
  <li>clean code (you can use linter)</li>
  <li>edge cases</li>
  <li>testing</li>
</ul>
